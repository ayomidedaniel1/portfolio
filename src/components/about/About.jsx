        <p>
          The main area of my expertise is the Frontend and everything related to the client side of the web. Using the python framework Django for the backend, I build small and medium web apps with feature rich content and animations using different frontend technologies - HTML, CSS, JS and React.js to create awesome user experiences.

        <p>
          I am enthusiastic in learning new technologies in which I have begun dabbling in React native. More than anything, I am always eager and willing to learn and adapt to the ever-changing facets of the web.
